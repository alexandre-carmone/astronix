# astronix

NixOS flake for two astrophotography machines and a gaming desktop.

## Hosts

| Host | hostName | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `astronix` | `astronomix` | The rig. Headless Plasma 6 on X11, SDDM autologin, xrdp, a fake EDID for the virtual display, a WiFi hotspot fallback, and the `junos-web` capture app. |
| `dev` | `inix` | The workstation. GNOME, DisplayLink dock, corporate CA and VPN bits, dev tooling. |
| `gamix` | `gamix` | The gaming desktop. GNOME on an NVIDIA card (open modules), Steam with Proton-GE and a gamescope session, Heroic, GameMode, MangoHud. |

All three run user `alexandre` and share the astro stack: INDI, KStars, PHD2, Siril.
The GNOME hosts (`dev`, `gamix`) each have a `-dark` twin for darkman.

```

Each host's `configuration.nix` only composes modules and adds what is unique
to that machine.

## Rebuild

`just` is installed on every host (see `modules/common.nix`); run it from this
repo. Recipes default to the host you are on — `astronomix` maps to `astronix`,
`gamix` to `gamix`, anything else to `dev` — and take a flake attribute for any
other:

```sh
just              # list every recipe
just switch       # rebuild + activate this host
just switch dev-dark
just diff         # build, then show what would change versus the running system
just check        # evaluate every host without building
just update       # bump every flake input
just gc 14        # drop generations older than 14 days, then collect garbage
```

The raw command still works:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#astronix   # the rig
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#dev        # the workstation
```

`update` is also a shell alias for `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` (see `modules/zsh.nix`).
